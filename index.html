<h1>Great White Sharks</h1>
<p>Great white sharks are a type of sharks that are quite famous. They are the largest predatory shark on Earth, meaning that they are the largest meat eating shark. They are also one of the top predators in the ocean, due to their heightend senses. They are usually found worldwide around coasts and tropical waters. They also migrate around the world in order to go to warmer water. Their primary diet includes, but not limited to, seals, sea lions, and dolphins. Great white sharks are mostly solitary, meaning that they wander around solo. Scientists are also starting to notice the intelligence of great white sharks, which is actually more complex than we think.</p>

<h2>Vulnerable</h2>
<p>As tough as the great white shark can seem, the species is considered vulnerable. This means that the population of the great white shark is decreasing. You may think that they are very dangerous to humans, but in reality, they rarely attack humans. And even when they do attack humans, it's due to the fact that they mistake us for prey. Even though they are one of the apex predators in the ocean, they have a very huge threat. And that threat is us humans. Poaching and illegal fishing result in the deaths of these sharks. This is very bad for the marine ecosystems because they are losing a predator to keep the other populations in check.  </p>
